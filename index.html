    <h2>ICED AMERICANO</h2>
    <p>An Iced Americano is made by diluting espresso with cold water and ice. It’s a simple, bold coffee drink with a clean, robust flavor—stronger than an iced latte but without the creaminess.

    <h2>ICED LATTE</h2> 
    <p>An Iced Latte is a chilled coffee drink made with espresso, cold milk, and ice. It’s smooth, creamy, and has a balanced coffee flavor, with the milk softening the espresso’s intensity.</p>
